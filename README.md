## Hi there! 👋

### 🏔 About Me

Hello! I'm Joshua Young, a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer residing in beautiful Nelson, British Columbia, open to both local and remote opportunities!

Formerly a Process Manager at a startup, I solved ambiguous problems by designing, implementing and managing business processes focused on improving efficiency and our margins. I recently transitioned into tech and earned a Web Development Diploma from BrainStation, however, the mission remains the same, to create creative and effective solutions to solve complex problems by leveraging powerful technologies.

As a Venure for Canada Fellow 🇨🇦 with a background in Sustainability, I'm also very interested in combining my skillsets to help Canadian startups working on issues of Sustainability or CleanTech to bring about positive change in our communities 🙏 🌎.
